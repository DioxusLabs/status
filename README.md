# status of dioxus org

This uses doxie-bot to track that status of things in the dioxus org.

This includes:
- Performance benchmarks
- Size, build times, and memory usage
- Code quality
- Security
- Dependencies
- Changed crates
- Open issues
- Open PRs
- etc

Whenever a change is merged on PRs that this repo watches, we re-run the bot to generate a new blob of status data which you can then view on the dioxuslabs.com website.

For now, we just use a github pages site to host and preview the data, but we do eventually want to move this to dioxuslabs.com and just query the data in this repo.
